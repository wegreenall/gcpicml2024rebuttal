In this folder we present the EC criterion diagrams constructed in response to 
reviewer 'shrW'. The the code for generating the diagrams is to be found in 
the corresponding python file.

The diagram in "ec_criterion_redwood.png" presents the EC criterion evaluated
for the redwood dataset on all orders $m = {5,40}$, for our method. The diagram
    in "ec_criterion_whiteoak.png" presents the EC criterion evaluated for the
    whiteoak dataset on all orders $m = {15,50}$, for our method. We consider
    that the "U"-shaped curve provides evidence that more complex models are
    not especially favored by the by the EC comparison method, as claimed by
    the reviewer. 

Since a lower value of this criterion means that the model places points closer
to where the true data are, EC preferring more complex models would imply that
this curve should be generally decreasing.

For all cases, the same parameterisations as when calculating the EC criterion
in the paper were used.
